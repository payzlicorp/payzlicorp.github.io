<h3 id="key-highlights">Key Highlights</h3>
<p>This patch primarily addresses known issues from last release in the Advance Search and GridView features. In addition to these enhancements, we have implemented several updates and fixes to improve the overall functionality and user experience of our platform.</p>

<h3 id="updates">Updates</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Partially Boarded Accounts: Accounts those were partially boarded/ in the process of being boarded are moved to open accounts.</li>
  <li>Enhanced User Experience Partner Leads Module: We’ve simplified the user experience for partner creation. Creating an organization and sales partner creation are now treated as two separate operations.</li>
  <li>Automatic Generation of Repay Sort Code: The Repay sort code will now be auto-generated while approving a sales partner, eliminating the need for manual creation of sort codes at various hierarchy levels.</li>
  <li>Attachment Functionality - PDF Upload Capability: The default image file type filter has been removed, allowing all file types by default when adding attachments.</li>
  <li>City Name Synchronization in Address Update: An issue where updating a city name (e.g., from ‘Central LA’ to ‘Los Angeles’) in the Business Address section within the Corporate Profile in Connect will properly reflect in MES.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="fixes">Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Custom PDF Handling in Partner Account Creation : Incorrect handling of custom PDFs in partner account creation has been addressed and resolved.</li>
  <li>Visa Product Enablement boarding error : handle visa product setup failure and allow to resume</li>
  <li>Slide Out UI Issues: Several slide out UI issues have been identified and fixed, leading to a smoother and more reliable user experience.</li>
</ul>

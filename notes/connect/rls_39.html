<p>This release is focusses on a mix of new features, bug fixes and several enhancements to streamline operations and onboarding activities.</p>

<h3 id="support-module-refactor">Support Module Refactor</h3>
<p>The new enhanced Support Module makes it easier for Payzli Internal Users, Partners and Merchants to communicate in a new consolidated view. The following features have been added:
- Support Table view is now trimmed with easier access to information
- Support Detailed view now has several new features:
    - Single screen for Email/SMS and Internal Notes, color-coded for ease
    - New Case detailed view with easier access to Merchant Profile and other important information
    - Ability to change the status of a ticket is now a dropdown option
- Sending messages now supports greater functionalities by choosing mode and from a selected list of users
- New enhanced screens for Merchant History and Case History
- Email communications will now be sent from <a href="mailto:support@payzli.com">support@payzli.com</a> (for internal users sending it), merchants@payzli.com (for merchant users) and <a href="mailto:partners@payzli.com">partners@payzli.com</a> (for partner users)
- Receive alerts on email when a new support case is opened
- Validations for support case documents based on case type
- Please note the Communication tab will be removed from merchant profile and integrated under Support</p>

<h3 id="partner-onboarding-refactor">Partner Onboarding Refactor</h3>
<p>As a part of refactoring and improving the Partner Onboarding experience on Connect, We have released the following changes:
- The Kanban view swim lanes have been consolidated with actions permitted based on the status.
- Lead cards will automatically move to the required status as per actions being completed
    - After sending an application, lead moved to a ‘Partner Application Sent’ lane/state
    - If modifications are needed, these can be retracted and agreement can be updated, marking the lead’s sub-status as “Contract in Negotiation”
    - Once the contract is signed, the lead is moved it to “Partner Underwriting”
         - Approved leads will go to “Completed” Bucket.
         - Declined leads will go to “Non-Responsive/Dead Leads” 
    - Sending a partner agreement now has a revamped flow to handle use cases such as residual agreements, attachments, paid by Payzli etc.</p>
